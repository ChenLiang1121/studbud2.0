## Based on feedbacks of previous assessment, I performed more close remote interviews with prototype as user testing to get more precise user needs and requirements for each section.
## Comparing to old version, I create a homepage as the guidance to briefly explain the web application purpose and provides links to each web tool, so users can immediately understand the website main theme.
## With the navigation bar unchanged on the left, I break all tools into different pages, so that each page’s purpose is unified and clear. User testing shows that users would be confused as they see timer, dictionary, and reference on the same page while three navi icons all lead to it. All pages shared the same navigation bar links to be unified.
## To fit design needs, Tasklist has being changed to the style of multiple input bars. Using multiple input types to get the task details.
## Users feedback show that calendar is not that helpful for planning, as both desktop and phone have easier access to the default calendar app and it’s a waste to put just calendar into one page.
## Kanban board holds almost the same concept, just with a little design change.
## Besides the stopwatch as the flow timer, I also add in a pomodoro timer as another style of timing. For design needs, both countdown and count upward timers are required, and also fit user needs in different situation.
## There’s only one required between dictionary and reference, so I keep the former as it is more useful in most cases. Targeted users have higher frequency of using dictionary than reference list.
